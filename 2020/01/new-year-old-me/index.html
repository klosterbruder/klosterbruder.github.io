		<div class="post-content"><p>The year 2019 has gone just as 2020 came, ringing in the decade of the (hopefully) golden &lsquo;20s once again (see also: <a href="https://xkcd.com/2249/">XKCD 2249</a>). All the while I realized that I have shamefully neglected the blog I started on a whim, even though actually having several topic ideas to write about. I have no excuse, I&rsquo;m just lazy like that. Getting from &ldquo;Oh, I could write about that!&rdquo; to an actual blog post that&rsquo;s not just an incoherent string of thought fragments always seems like way too much of a pain in the rear department for the precious free minutes between youtube, random webpages and my warm bed.</p>

<p>I will try to better myself, though. It&rsquo;s not really a resolution for the new year, but I will strive for releasing one post every month over a 10-year average. Whether that means about 100 twitter-lenght posts of muddled sentences in december 2029 will remain to be seen. Thinking realistically, it&rsquo;ll be the latter.</p>

<p>Until next post, I wish you a happy and healthy 2020.</p>
