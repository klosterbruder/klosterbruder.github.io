      <description>Fasten your seatbelts, it&amp;rsquo;s going to get awkward.
awk, together with grep, sed and fellows like tr, wc or cut are standard tools for commandline text processing on Linux, BSD and other Unix-based operating systems. They&amp;rsquo;re also bread-and-butter tools for sysadmins. Can&amp;rsquo;t remember which config file a certain setting was in? grep for it. Someone wants to know how many requests the webserver served yesterday? wc to the rescue! And so on.</description>

      <description>Hello, World!
For some years now, I thought I should start a blog. Either because everyone and their grandma has one, or because I had exactly one more or less nonsensical idea I could&amp;rsquo;ve thrown out onto the internet. Being lazy as heck was the main deterrent of actually doing it, the other one was a mindset of having to do it &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; on first try. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure what &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; means in the context of blogging, so those attempts didn&amp;rsquo;t last much longer.</description>
