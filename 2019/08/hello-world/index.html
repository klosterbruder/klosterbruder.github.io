		<div class="post-content"><p>Hello, World!</p>

<p>For some years now, I thought I should start a blog. Either because everyone and their grandma has one, or because I had exactly <em>one</em> more or less nonsensical idea I could&rsquo;ve thrown out onto the internet. Being lazy as heck was the main deterrent of actually doing it, the other one was a mindset of having to do it &ldquo;right&rdquo; on first try. I&rsquo;m not even sure what &ldquo;right&rdquo; means in the context of blogging, so those attempts didn&rsquo;t last much longer.</p>

<p>Recently, a friend told me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to push out something &lsquo;crappy&rsquo; then nothing at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, err, yea. Here we are.</p>

<p>I am a tech guy, a Sysadmin. I can also do a bit of programming, but I&rsquo;m far from good at it. The topics covered in my posts will (mainly?) be tech-related as well. They are published in hopes someone will find them funny, interesting or even helpful, but without any expressed or implied guarantees of being successful or even non-harmful. But you wouldn&rsquo;t <code>curl | sudo bash</code> anything unchecked from elsewhere on the internet either, right? Right?!</p>

<p>This blog is made with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, which is a fast static website generator written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. At the moment, I&rsquo;m using the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/solar-theme-hugo/">Solar</a> theme. Both theme and site structure may be subject to change, though, as I&rsquo;m still experimenting a lot with Hugo.</p>
