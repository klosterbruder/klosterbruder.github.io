		<div class="post-content"><p>The case of Mailspring.</p>
<p>Today, I was in need of a mail client for testing a server. I didn&rsquo;t want to use my usual one, since that one is overloaded with accounts already. Installing one of the other big and well-known mail clients or -suites didn&rsquo;t sound too appealing either. So I went to the search engine of my distrust, and keyed in &ldquo;simple imap client linux&rdquo;, in hopes of being presented with a list of small and simple IMAP mail clients.</p>
<p>The first hit was <a href="https://itsfoss.com/best-email-clients-linux/">Top 9 Best Email Clients for Linux</a> on itsfoss.com. Well, okay, let&rsquo;s have a look. First suggestion is <a href="https://getmailspring.com/">Mailspring</a>. It&rsquo;s described as &ldquo;built with open web technologies&rdquo; (oh, great, it&rsquo;s Chrome) and having features like &ldquo;Unified Inbox&rdquo;, &ldquo;Contacts Management&rdquo;, &ldquo;Analytics &amp; Tracking&rdquo; and much more &ndash; yeah, okay, don&rsquo;t care, as long as it can do IMAP.</p>
<p>Their site itself gushes about being the &ldquo;best mail client&rdquo;, &ldquo;boosted productivity&rdquo;, &ldquo;gesture support&rdquo; (really, now?), and of course, themes! Everyone loves some themes, right? Well, let&rsquo;s download it. <code>.rpm</code>, <code>.deb</code> or a <code>Snap</code> are available for Linux. Since my work box (still) runs Ubuntu, this isn&rsquo;t much of a brain-teaser. Two <code>dpkg -i</code>s with an <code>apt -f install</code> in the middle later, I&rsquo;m ready for action.</p>
<p>When I start it, the thing greeting me is a welcome screen, then kind of &ldquo;First steps&rdquo;, and then&hellip;an unskippable sign-up screen for a Mailspring ID. Seriously?</p>
<p><img src="mailspring.jpg" alt="Mailspring ID"></p>
<p>I had an inkling they might be squidding me, but no. To use Mailspring, you need a Mailspring ID. In an FAQ entry, aptly named <a href="https://foundry376.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003141552">What is a Mailspring ID and why do I need one?</a>, they describe how you need one for the themes (Oh no!) and plugins, and to sync your settings across multiple devices &ndash; settings like mail snooze. I may be old-fashioned, but if I don&rsquo;t want to be bothered by mails, I close the mail client. This has the major advantage of also working for messengers, RSS readers and so on.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Yeah, nah. Mailspring is <strong>out</strong>. Someone who requires me to create an account with <em>them</em>, just so I can use another account (mail, in this case) I have <em>elsewhere</em> has lost right from the start. Thanks, but no, thanks, especially after only telling me about the Mailspring ID business after I have downloaded and installed it.</p>
<pre><code>apt remove mailspring
</code></pre></div>
