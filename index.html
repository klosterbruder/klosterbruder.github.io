				<p>After a long time of planning, I finally ordered parts for a new PC last year. Black Friday seemed the best time to order, even though there were less deals than I&rsquo;d have wanted. While waiting for my orders to be shipped, I also found out the availability numbers in the shops were a bit overstated. That might be worth a rant for itself, but sometimes one should just let bygones be bygones.  … </p>

				<p>The year 2019 has gone just as 2020 came, ringing in the decade of the (hopefully) golden &lsquo;20s once again (see also: XKCD 2249). All the while I realized that I have shamefully neglected the blog I started on a whim, even though actually having several topic ideas to write about. I have no excuse, I&rsquo;m just lazy like that. Getting from &ldquo;Oh, I could write about that!&rdquo; to an actual blog post that&rsquo;s not just an incoherent string of thought fragments always seems like way too much of a pain in the rear department for the precious free minutes between youtube, random webpages and my warm bed.  … </p>

				<p>The case of Mailspring.
Today, I was in need of a mail client for testing a server. I didn&rsquo;t want to use my usual one, since that one is overloaded with accounts already. Installing one of the other big and well-known mail clients or -suites didn&rsquo;t sound too appealing either. So I went to the search engine of my distrust, and keyed in &ldquo;simple imap client linux&rdquo;, in hopes of being presented with a list of small and simple IMAP mail clients.  … </p>

				<p>Why, hello again. My last awkward post was but a single scratch on the surface of what awk can do. With this post, I will try to add a second one.
The first example will involve a CSV file. CSV &ndash; comma-separated values &ndash; is a file type that presents values in a more or less tabular form, but instead of separated by spaces, they&rsquo;re separated by commas. Who would&rsquo;ve thought, huh?  … </p>

				<p>Fasten your seatbelts, it&rsquo;s going to get awkward.
awk, together with grep, sed and fellows like tr, wc or cut are standard tools for commandline text processing on Linux, BSD and other Unix-based operating systems. They&rsquo;re also bread-and-butter tools for sysadmins. Can&rsquo;t remember which config file a certain setting was in? grep for it. Someone wants to know how many requests the webserver served yesterday? wc to the rescue! And so on.  … </p>

				<p>Hello, World!
For some years now, I thought I should start a blog. Either because everyone and their grandma has one, or because I had exactly one more or less nonsensical idea I could&rsquo;ve thrown out onto the internet. Being lazy as heck was the main deterrent of actually doing it, the other one was a mindset of having to do it &ldquo;right&rdquo; on first try. I&rsquo;m not even sure what &ldquo;right&rdquo; means in the context of blogging, so those attempts didn&rsquo;t last much longer.  … </p>
