		<div class="post-content"><p>The year 2020 is over. It&rsquo;s 2021. And after a&hellip;time, I&rsquo;ve finally set out to actually complete a blog post again.</p>
<p>A&hellip;time, yes. 2020 seemed so long, and at the same time so short. So much happened, and yet almost nothing did. The news were full of ever-changing situations, and yet it was the same over and over again. The arrival of Christmas was an actual surprise for me, I have to admit. Working from home was comfortable, but despite the additional time, I got little additional stuff done. The things I did get done were putting my PC into a workable state and thereby migrating back from Ubuntu to Gentoo. A few of my planned and/or started posts are about interesting experiences I had along the way. Taking a bit more or better care of my blog is, again, a plan for this year.</p>
<p>Speaking of my blog. I fixed a few spelling mistakes in old posts, and at the same time went from Hugo 0.58 to 0.78. Regenerating the static pages got me this:</p>
<pre><code>19 files changed, 83 insertions(+), 230 deletions(-)
</code></pre><p>Whoa. Ain&rsquo;t that a tad much?</p>
<p>Until next post, I wish you whatever you wish for yourself and those dear to you. &ldquo;Happy and healthy&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t work out that well last year, after all.</p>
