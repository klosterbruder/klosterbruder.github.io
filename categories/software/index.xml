      <description>A few customers at my work still use Elasticsearch version 5, because their software doesn&amp;rsquo;t support anything newer. The facts their software doesn&amp;rsquo;t support anything newer, or that Elasticsearch has enough differences between versions to cause these incompatibilities would be worth rants of their own, but this is different.
So I was deploying a new software. And on a few servers, the deployment fell over - updating the apt cache failed.</description>

      <description>The case of Mailspring.
Today, I was in need of a mail client for testing a server. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use my usual one, since that one is overloaded with accounts already. Installing one of the other big and well-known mail clients or -suites didn&amp;rsquo;t sound too appealing either. So I went to the search engine of my distrust, and keyed in &amp;ldquo;simple imap client linux&amp;rdquo;, in hopes of being presented with a list of small and simple IMAP mail clients.</description>
