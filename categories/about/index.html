				<p>The year 2020 is over. It&rsquo;s 2021. And after a&hellip;time, I&rsquo;ve finally set out to actually complete a blog post again.
A&hellip;time, yes. 2020 seemed so long, and at the same time so short. So much happened, and yet almost nothing did. The news were full of ever-changing situations, and yet it was the same over and over again. The arrival of Christmas was an actual surprise for me, I have to admit.  … </p>

				<p>Hello, World!
For some years now, I thought I should start a blog. Either because everyone and their grandma has one, or because I had exactly one more or less nonsensical idea I could&rsquo;ve thrown out onto the internet. Being lazy as heck was the main deterrent of actually doing it, the other one was a mindset of having to do it &ldquo;right&rdquo; on first try. I&rsquo;m not even sure what &ldquo;right&rdquo; means in the context of blogging, so those attempts didn&rsquo;t last much longer.  … </p>
