      <description>The year 2020 is over. It&amp;rsquo;s 2021. And after a&amp;hellip;time, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally set out to actually complete a blog post again.
A&amp;hellip;time, yes. 2020 seemed so long, and at the same time so short. So much happened, and yet almost nothing did. The news were full of ever-changing situations, and yet it was the same over and over again. The arrival of Christmas was an actual surprise for me, I have to admit.</description>

      <description>The year 2019 has gone just as 2020 came, ringing in the decade of the (hopefully) golden &amp;rsquo;20s once again (see also: XKCD 2249). All the while I realized that I have shamefully neglected the blog I started on a whim, even though actually having several topic ideas to write about. I have no excuse, I&amp;rsquo;m just lazy like that. Getting from &amp;ldquo;Oh, I could write about that!&amp;rdquo; to an actual blog post that&amp;rsquo;s not just an incoherent string of thought fragments always seems like way too much of a pain in the rear department for the precious free minutes between Youtube, random web pages and my warm bed.</description>

      <description>Hello, World!
For some years now, I thought I should start a blog. Either because everyone and their grandma has one, or because I had exactly one more or less nonsensical idea I could&amp;rsquo;ve thrown out onto the internet. Being lazy as heck was the main deterrent of actually doing it, the other one was a mindset of having to do it &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; on first try. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure what &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; means in the context of blogging, so those attempts didn&amp;rsquo;t last much longer.</description>
